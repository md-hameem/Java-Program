# Array List Operations

This Java program demonstrates various operations on array lists, including inserting a new value into an ordered list, testing equality of two lists, copying a list to another, filling a list with zeros, and deleting all elements from a list.

## Files

- `ArrayOrders.java`: Contains the implementation of the array list operations.

## Functionality

### Main Function

The `main` function demonstrates the functionality of each operation by performing the following tasks:
- Inserting a new value into an ordered list.
- Testing whether two lists contain the same elements in the same order.
- Copying an array list to another array list.
- Filling an array list with zeros.
- Deleting all elements of an array list.

### Operations

1. **Insert Value in Order** (`insertValueInOrder`): Inserts a new value into an ordered list such that the resulting array remains ordered.
2. **Test List Equality** (`areListsEqual`): Tests whether two array lists contain the same elements in the same order.
3. **Copy List** (`copyList`): Copies an array list to another array list.
4. **Fill List with Zero** (`fillListWithZero`): Fills an array list with zeros, overriding all elements.
5. **Delete All Elements** (`deleteAllElements`): Deletes all elements of an array list.

## Example Usage

```java
public class ArrayOrders {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Implementation of operations demonstrated in the main function
    }

    // Other functions are similar to those described in the Functionality section
}
```

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
javac ArrayOrders.java
java ArrayOrders
```

## Acknowledgments

- This program demonstrates common array list operations in Java.
- It provides examples of how to insert elements into an ordered list, test list equality, copy lists, fill lists with zeros, and delete all elements from a list.
