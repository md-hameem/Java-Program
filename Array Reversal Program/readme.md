# Array Reversal Program

This Java program reverses an array of integers. It takes an array as input, reverses its elements, and prints the reversed array.

## Files

- `ReverseArray.java`: Contains the implementation of the array reversal program.

## Functionality

### Main Function

The `main` function initializes an array with integer elements, prints the original array, calls the `reverseArray` function to reverse the array, and then prints the reversed array.

### `reverseArray` Function

This function reverses the elements of the input array by swapping the elements from the start and end of the array until they meet in the middle.

## Example Usage

```java
public class ReverseArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Implementation demonstrated in the main function
    }

    // Other functions are similar to those described in the Functionality section
}
```

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
javac ReverseArray.java
java ReverseArray
```

## Acknowledgments

- This program demonstrates a common operation of reversing an array of integers.
- It provides an efficient solution by swapping elements from both ends of the array until they meet in the middle.
